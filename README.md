## Hi I am Teravibe! (Nick) 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a tech enthusiast who loves building tools, tinkering with servers, and writing code that does something useful — especially when it involves APIs and web apps.

### 🛠️ What I Do (for fun and for work)

- 🌍 I enjoy building **web apps**, especially ones that interact with **APIs**. I’ve built tools for games like *EVE Online*, like my app [industrialEVE](https://industrialeve.com/) and I'm always playing around with new ideas.
- 🧰 I like the backend side of things — mostly working with **Python**, **Django**, and a bit of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
- 🖥️ I like working with **Linux servers** — I can set up a VPS, configure services, deploy web apps, and automate stuff with scripts. Not a full-time sysadmin, but I enjoy that kind of work.
- 👨‍💼 In my day job, I work as an **Incident Manager / Change & Release Manager** at a multinational company, dealing with production environments and processes at scale.
- 📚 I'm studying **Computer Science** to deepen my technical skills and challenge myself.
